# pi-dns

Official repository for [pi-dns.com](https://pi-dns.com). All software developed or tailored for the project will be hosted here and made available for the public to view.

## Info

This repository is under construction. Most of the code hosted here is missing documentation on how it should be setup and installed. I will add that once I have time.

## Todo

- Add install instructions/documentation on how a pi-dns server is setup.
  - Add all config files to this repo.
- Add documentation to the custom code developed for pi-dns.
- Automate the setup of a pi-dns server using ansible
  - Should really be prioritized!
